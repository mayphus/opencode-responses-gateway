# OpenCode Go Menu Bar App

A native macOS menu bar app (Swift + AppKit, Swift Package Manager) that controls the
opencode-go-proxy Python bridge.

The menu bar shows a small branch icon (no long "opencode go/" text). The menu shows:

- status (Running / Stopped, with live health check against `/health`)
- port (default 8787)
- Start/Stop Proxy: launches `uvx --from git+... opencode-go-proxy` as a child process,
  writing logs to `~/.codex/logs/opencode-go-proxy.{log,err}` (same paths as the launchd plist)
- Open Logs / Reveal Log File
- Copy Port
- Quit (stops the child proxy first)

## Build

```bash
cd macos/MenuBarApp
swift build
```

Requires macOS 13+ and the Swift toolchain (`xcode-select --install`). This is a SwiftPM
executable target, so `swift build` works without an Xcode project. To bundle it as a .app:

```bash
swift build -c release
cp -R .build/release/OpenCodeGoMenuBar OpenCodeGoMenuBar.app/Contents/MacOS/
```

## Notes

- The Python bridge is untouched; the app only manages it as a child process.
- Do not run this app and the launchd agent at the same time: both bind 127.0.0.1:8787 and
  the second one will fail to bind. Stop the launchd agent first
  (`launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.opencode-go.proxy.plist`).
- The proxy resolves the API key exactly as the CLI does: `$OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` first, then
  the macOS keychain service `opencode-go-api-key`.
